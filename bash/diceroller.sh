# Improve this script by adding a second line of output showing a roll of 5 six-sided dice
# Improve this script by adding a third line of output that rolls a single 20-sided die
# These improvements should also take into consideration the user, and make all 3 output lines self-explanatory to the user
#    - e.g. the first line should be changed to read something like:
#         Rolling a pair of standard dice: x,y rolled
#      and the other output lines should be similarly helpful to the user

# roll the dice and display the result
